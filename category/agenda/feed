										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Covid-19 pandemic does not reduce student productivity and their desire to show their interests and talents. The university has a duty to support the development of student activities, especially interests and talents as a form of supporting student achievement. For this reason, Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta (UMY) encourages students to be involved in participating in two national competitions organized by the Ministry of Education and Culture of the Republic of Indonesia (Kemendikbud RI).</p>
<p>The two national competitions are the National Student Arts Week (PEKSIMINAS) which was held on 9-15 November 2020 and the Indonesian Student Film Festival (FFMI) which will be held on 25-27 November 2020, with the announcement of the winners on 30 November. In the National Student Arts Week (PEKSIMINAS) competition, UMY appointed 28 participants who will take part in 14 competitions and delegated two teams in the Indonesian Student Film Festival (FFMI) competitions, with a total of 60 participants consisting of 2017-2020 students.</p>
<p>Rozikan, SEI, MSI, Head of the Student Interest and Talent Development Division said when contacted on Tuesday (17/11) that the UMY Student and Alumni Development Institute (LPKA UMY) facilitated UMY students with their interests and talents to participate in two national level competitions, namely PEKSIMINAS and FFMI. &#8220;There are two national level competition agendas that the UMY students are participating in, namely PEKSIMINAS which was participated by 28 participants in 14 competitions which have various categories ranging from individual to group and male and female categories, while in the FFMI competition, UMY send two teams by submitting two fictional films. Both competitions are conducted online considering the current conditions in the Covid-19 pandemic,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>Rozikan also added that the competition, which is held every two years, is an opportunity to support student achievement. Therefore, LPKA UMY conducts internal selection to provide guidance to online national competitions. &#8220;UMY, through LPKA, fosters its students by accommodating preparation for competitions such as training sessions which were held one month before the competition, and Student Activity Units (UKM) involved in the competition, including UKM Dance Sentaka Mudya, Music UKM, UKM Sunshine Voice, UKM Theater Tangga, UKM RPC, UKM Nuansa and IMM for participants of the National Student Art Week and for UKM Kine and the CIKO Community who were participants in the Student Film Festival competition,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rozikan hopes that by participating in the two national level competition, the students can be more enthusiastic and show their achievements with their interests and talents. &#8220;This is the first time UMY has participated in two national competitions in one month. By participating in the competition, we can raise the enthusiasm of students, and this can serve as proof that UMY facilitates the interests and talents of its students through the most prestigious competitions, so that by participating in the competition, we hoped that it can produce new achievements for students,&#8221; he concluded.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Public health in handling the COVID-19 pandemic is a shared responsibility of each individual and collective. Cooperation from all parties can be a weapon to &#8220;fight&#8221; this pandemic. This was conveyed by Prof. Wiku Adisasmito, Head of the Task Force for the Acceleration of Handling COVID-19 of the Republic of Indonesia, who gave his presentation in the 3rd Community Service Webinar panel discussion session, Wednesday (11/11) yesterday.</p>
<p>In the webinar that was broadcasted live from the 5th Floor Meeting Room, AR Fachruddin B Building, Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta (UMY), Wiku also explained how the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) took part and made policies during this pandemic period in Indonesia.</p>
<p>Wiku said that Indonesia is currently in a phase public health emergency. But unfortunately, there are still many who do not realize that health problems have another dimension in social life. This other dimension can lead to differences in opinion between groups and a tug of war in dealing with a disease that is relatively unknown in the world. The role of the government, which has formed a task force to coordinate in dealing with this matter at a national level, also needs to be supported by public disciplinary behavior. “Individual discipline can be done by implementing Imun, Iman, Aman (Immune, Faith, Safety). Immune, namely maintaining body immunity by getting enough rest, exercise, not panicking, having fun, and consuming nutritious foods. Faith is worship. And stay safe by applying the 4M (wearing a mask, keeping your distance, washing hands, and avoiding crowds), &#8220;he added.</p>
<p>On the same occasion, Drs. Agus Samsudin, M.M., Director of the Muhammadiyah COVID-19 Command Center (MCCC), added that community organizations such as the MCCC can assist the government in dealing with the pandemic if it is done more intensely. MCCC itself has made various responses and efforts to handle COVID-19 such as providing health services, raising funds, also conducting advocacy, communication, and collaboration with various parties related to the COVID-19 pandemic. &#8220;Dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic is a form of the spirit of Al-Mauun. Community service activities like this are Muhammadiyah&#8217;s obligation to the nation&#8221; he said. (ays)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43960" src="http://dummy.umy.ac.id/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_20200305_165919.jpg" alt="" width="4000" height="3000" />The number of visits in the tourism sector in recent years has made many tourist destinations in the Special Region of Yogyakarta, especially natural tourism, to thrive. One of the tourist destinations that are currently viral is the Becici Peak in Dlingo, Bantul Regency. Unfortunately, there is no realization of the 7th Sapta Pesona in the area, namely Memories in the form of non-food products. This problem was addressed by two lecturers from the English Education Study Program of UMY, Puthut Ardianto and Mariska Intan Sari, who both initiated a signature souvenir from Dlingo in the form of an ecoprint.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did we choose Ecoprint? Because Dlingo has an abundance of natural resources. These natural resources are the main elements of ecoprint production. That&#8217;s why we chose to hold a signature souvenir program in the form of ecoprint,&#8221; said Puthut as the head of the program, on Wednesday. (11/11).</p>
<p>To be able to produce this ecoprint souvenir product, Mariska and her team have carried out six training programs which were carried out with 22 people from villages in Dlingo District from February to June 2020. Participants were trained starting from the main fabric care (treatment) which included scouring and mordanting, then printing and finally pattern and color locking. &#8220;The women participating in this ecoprint training already have a positive mindset, so we (the implementation team) had an easy time transferring our knowledge to them. In addition, participants also have high motivation to learn new things so that it is quite easy for mentors to learn together.&#8221; said Mariska as a member of the executive team.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, the training continues online via a Whatsapp group. The participants were quite enthusiastic about trying out the direct practice of making ecoprint fabrics, guided by a remote mentor. Koniah, one of the trainees said that this training was very beneficial for them because in addition to gaining new knowledge, they also gained skills that could support their family income.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Mount Merapi in Yogyakarta is currently in the status of Alert Level III, which means that it has a high probability of erupting.

The<p><a href="https://www.umy.ac.id/the-constitutional-understanding-rights-of-citizens-in-the-mount-merapi-disaster-risk-area-in-sleman-regency-di-yogyakarta"></a></p>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43956" src="http://dummy.umy.ac.id/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ABDIMAS.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" />Mount Merapi in Yogyakarta is currently in the status of Alert Level III, which means that it has a high probability of erupting. As we know, the consequences of an eruption includes the loss of life and other such impacts that can be felt by the community, such as economic, social, and physical impacts. The state has an obligation to restore the rights of citizens after a disaster, especially for residents around the slopes of the mountains so that they can return to their original life.</p>
<p>This problem led to a community service program conducted by three lecturers at Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta consisting of Assoc. Prof. Iwan Satriawan, Ph.D., Prof. Agus Setyo Muntohar, Ph.D., and Assoc. Prof. Sunarno, Ph.D., in the form of a Partner Village Development Program (PPDM) in Donoharjo Village, Ngaglik District, Sleman Regency, D.I.Yogyakarta.</p>
<p>Iwan, who is also a lecturer at the UMY Faculty of Law, conveyed the results of his discussion in a parallel session of Community Service Webinar 3 which was broadcast virtually through the UMYogya Youtube channel on Wednesday (11/11). &#8220;The aim is to provide education and understanding to the public regarding what citizens&#8217; rights must be fulfilled by the state after a disaster based on the 1945 Constitution,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, after counseling was carried out in Donoharjo village by the UMY community service team, it was found that many people still did not know about disaster knowledge, disaster regulations, disaster management actions, and the constitutional rights of disaster-affected citizens. &#8220;Those are the four indicators of this service program, so disaster regulation is indeed important because people need to know what should and should not be done in dealing with disasters, especially for people around the slopes of Merapi,&#8221; continued Agus, a lecturer in UMY Civil Engineering.</p>
<p>Actually, Indonesia already has adequate instruments for the disaster management process, as it has legal protection as well as a special agency that can handle it. &#8220;The most important thing is how citizens can fulfill their rights as stated in Law No.24 of 2007 regarding disasters. And disaster management cannot be separated from political intervention,&#8221; said Agus. (Hbb)</p>

Universities are required to adapt to this pandemic. Universities must make various efforts to adapt and at the same time make a real contribution to society in facing the pandemic.</p>
<p>That was the common thread in the opening of the Abdimas 3 Webinar organized by the Publication, Research and Community Service Institute (LP3M) of Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta, on Wednesday (11/11). The webinar with the theme &#8220;Technology Innovation and Information Technology Development in Post-COVID-19 Community Empowerment&#8221; was held as a form of university contribution to answer challenges regarding problems in community empowerment. This activity is also a discussion forum for academics to answer problematic challenges in society in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic and to take steps to adapt to acceleration in the era of disruption to build a civilized society.</p>
<p>The Director General of Higher Education, Ministry of Education and Culture of the Republic of Indonesia, Prof. Ir. Nizam, M.Sc., as the keynote speaker in the Abdimas 3 Webinar explained that several efforts have been made by universities to adapt to the Covid-19 pandemic, based on the Tridharma of Higher Education. These efforts include developing technological innovations and information technology, as well as the Merdeka Belajar program. &#8220;The output generated from this development is the existence of online learning that can be done by taking cross-study programs and across campuses, student volunteer activities, student independent projects, applied research with lecturers, and lecturer research especially related to pandemic mitigation in the form of applied research and the existence of community service,&#8221; he explained via an online medium.</p>
<p>In addition, adaptation is also carried out by utilizing learning technology for lecturers through the implementation of independent learning. &#8220;For example, collaborative and interdisciplinary online learning, student humanitarian volunteer activities (KKN Online), projects and independent research with lecturers, especially for socio-economic recovery. Then there is the reparation or improvement in the quality of online learning with assessment learning methods, management, conducting training or upgrading learning online for lecturers and students as well as improvement of lecture models. In addition, there is also strengthening and improvement of learning platforms and network infrastructure in collaboration with the Ministry of Communication and Information and internet providers, as well as the merah putih webinar platform and the SPADA ICE Institute,&#8221; said Nizam.</p>
<p>Nizam also stated that there are lessons that can be taken in dealing with this Covid-19 pandemic. Namely, the need to adapt quickly to the use of learning technology. &#8220;At times like this, whatever the challenges, work from home is no less productive than working in an office, and creative energy can even increase during the pandemic. More than a thousand inventions and innovations are produced by universities and the spirit of mutual cooperation is awakened and strong when facing the current pandemic,&#8221; added Nizam again.</p>
<p>The same thing was also conveyed by the Rector of UMY, Dr. Ir Gunawan Budiyanto MP IPM. According to him, Higher education has a role to provide solutions to problems in society, especially during the pandemic. &#8220;To respond to this challenge, higher education institutions should not stop having discussions about social impacts and solutions for handling it. The Abdimas 3 Community Service Webinar it becomes a forum for discussion to think about how and what solutions can be done to generate social and economic potential in the community. This community service webinar is also an academic transaction that emphasizes rationality to answer challenges and problems that occur in society. Hopefully, this Community Service Webinar will become a form of contribution from universities to solve problems with real proof solutions,&#8221; concluded Gunawan. (Sofia)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Medical personnel, such as doctors, are high-risk jobs, especially during a pandemic because they have to deal directly with patients. When it comes to dentists, the level of risk is very high because their method of examination is related to the patient&#8217;s oral and dental health. As such, the 2020 DREAM (Dental Research Exhibition and Meeting) was held with the theme &#8220;Multidiscipline Intercollaboration in New Normal Era&#8221; to update dentists&#8217; knowledge regarding how to treat patients and what protocols and recommendations should be taken for practices during a the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>DREAM 2020 is a biennial routine activity organized by the Dentistry Study Program, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences (FKIK), Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta (UMY). Unlike the 2018 DREAM which was held offline, with a target of thousands of participants, this year, DREAM was held both online and offline with a maximum limit of 200 offline participants. DREAM 2020 also collaborates with ICOSI which was held some time ago in terms of research and paper conferences. The event was held for 3 days from Thursday (05/11) to Friday (06/11) for online sessions, then Saturday (07/11) for the offline session at Hotel Royal Ambarrukmo, Yogyakarta.</p>
<p>According to drg. Iwan Dewanto, MMR., Ph.D, Chief Executive of DREAM 2020, this activity is the first activity held during the pandemic period and also the first offline activity held by the Indonesian Dentists Association (PDGI) throughout Indonesia. &#8220;Of course, we have permission and recommendations from the DIY COVID-19 Task Force team, the Health Office, and also from UMY. We were also directly monitored by a team from PGDI, and we were tapped a guide for PDGI&#8217;s next offline events,&#8221; he said when contacted by the Bureau of Human Relations and Protocol, Saturday (07/11).</p>
<p>There were two sessions in DREAM 2020, namely a seminar session and a hands-on session which includes a “practicum” session. The seminar was filled with 11 presenters who came from Indonesia, especially UMY, and also from other countries such as Malaysia. The hands-on session was filled by 10 presenters who were divided according to their fields. In addition to gaining knowledge, the implementation of DREAM 2020 can also help dentists to get receive SKP (Professional Credit Unit) to be used in renewing their practice license. (ays)</p>

To socialize this, the General Election Commission (KPU) of the Special Region of Yogyakarta (DIY) conducted an online seminar or webinar titled KPU Goes To Campus with the theme &#8220;Pilkada Amid Pandemic: Why Not?&#8221; with Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta (UMY) on Thursday (05/11).</p>
<p>The seminar was held through the Zoom Meeting platform and was broadcast via YouTube KPU DIY. The event, which was moderated by David Efendi, S.IP., MA., was filled by several speakers, namely Siti Ghoniyatun as Head of the Law and Supervisory Division of the KPU DIY, Bambang Eka Cahya Widodo, M.Sc., as a lecturer in Government Science at UMY, and Dr. . phil. Ridho Al-Hamdi, MA., as a lecturer in Government Science at UMY.</p>
<p>In her presentation, Siti explained that to face the implementation of the upcoming 2020 regional elections, the KPU as the organizer must ensure the safety, health and security of the election participants. This is a new challenge. So, the KPU intensively and proactively conducts outreach to ensure that the elections can be carried out in a democratic, healthy and safe manner. The KPU also collaborates with various parties, especially the Indonesian Bawaslu and TNI / POLRI to provide security during the election activities which will take place in 9 provinces and 270 districts/cities in addition to a COVID-19 task force. &#8220;In addition, the KPU also added 1 principle in holding elections, namely the principle of health and safety based on the protocol for health prevention and control of COVID-19,&#8221; explained Siti.</p>
<p>In order to prevent the formation of new clusters at each stage of the election implementation, health protocols must be tightened. Campaigns must be conducted with a limited number of meetings and online methods. In line with this, Bambang added that social media can be used to gain community involvement to participate actively in participating in the implementation process of the 2020 elections. &#8220;When using social media, each candidate must prepare high-quality methods, considering the people have limited interaction compared to social media,&#8221; he said.

<p>The village of West Wirosaban RT 58 RW 17, Sorosutan, Umbulharjo District, Yogyakarta has a plantation area filled with vegetable crops. But unfortunately, the people in the area do not have much free time to manage vegetable plantations, especially in terms of the effectiveness of watering time, due to the daily activities of residents who work as office employees. A Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta University community service team consisting of Ir. Tony K Hariadi MT. IPM., Widyasmoro ST. M.Sc., Ir. Agus Jamal M.Eng., IPM., Provided assistance in the form of automatic plant watering devices powered by solar power (solar panels), on Tuesday (3/11).</p>
<p>This assistance also provides an example for the community on how to utilize renewable energy. &#8220;Apart from being a lecturer in Electrical Engineering, I am also part of the Center for Regional Energy Management Studies (PUSPER), Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta (UMY), which aims to provide an example for the public on how to utilize renewable energy (renewable energy) such as the sun, which can be obtained for free. Many people do not realize that even though the cost is quite expensive, solar panel devices can reduce the monthly cost of electricity, &#8220;explained Tony K Hariadi, when met at the location of the aid delivery.</p>
<p>The tool itself is made with a timer component, voltage regulation, a hose as a water supply, a battery that is used to store solar power, and a rectangular solar panel to capture and flow solar energy to the battery. The community service team from UMY not only provided assistance but also provided their time for installation and provided knowledge on how to use and care for it.</p>
<p>The head of RT 58, Hari Widyasaya, admitted that he was very happy with the assistance of this tool. According to him, the automatic plant sprinklers powered by solar panels will make it easier for residents to care for their plantations. &#8220;We are very grateful for the assistance of this tool, because with this tool, residents can care for their vegetable crops and improve the quality and quantity of food security in the village of West Wirosaban RT 58.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hari said that this plantation had been around for six years and for the last two years, residents had been intensively developing the plantation. &#8220;It has been around since six years ago, and in the last two years, we have been very active in developing this sector. There are 12 types of vegetables in our plantations, and the shallot plant is the most successful at this time. We do have hopes of turning our village, especially RT 58, into a tourist destination,&#8221; he said. (Hbb)</p>

<p>Ari Kusuma Paksi, Ph.D, vice chairman of the ICOSI 2020 executive through his remarks expressed his gratitude to the participants who participated in this conference. &#8220;We are honored that you have trusted us, ICOSI, as a platform to share your research results,&#8221; he said. Ari added that even though we are in the middle of a pandemic, this conference was successfully held virtually.</p>
<p>With a total of 1,112 presentations on various topics and participants from various backgrounds, ICOSI 2020 succeeded in gathering various innovations and thoughts. The achievement of ICOSI 2020 was also successfully noted by the Indonesian Record Museum (MURI) as the virtual international conference with the most disciplines. This achievement, according to the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs, Dr. Ir. Sukamta, S.T., M.T., IPM who was present to officially close ICOSI 2020, is an opportunity to be even more productive.</p>
<p>When giving his closing remarks, Sukamta thanked the co-hosts of ICOSI 2020 who had agreed to participate in the implementation of this conference. &#8220;Even though it was only held for 2 days, we hope that the results of the discussion and sharing at this conference will provide many benefits in the future,&#8221; he said. He also added that the success of this conference was inseparable from the hard work of the committee, who even after the event still had the responsibility to take notes and distribute all papers at this conference until they are published and indexed by Scopus. &#8220;Hopefully we can all meet next year, at the fifth ICOSI 2021 event,&#8221; he concluded.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Legal issues are an important matter for social life. In addition, law is closely related to religion and civilization. The explanation was given by Prof. Dr. K.H. Muhammad Sirajudin Syamsudin, MA., Chairperson of the Muhammadiyah Central Board for the 2005-2010 and 2010-2015 Periods in the International Conference on Law and Society 2020 (ICLAS) on Wednesday (14/10) which was conducted online. ICLAS is a series of events in the 4th ICOSI 2020.</p>
<p>Prof. Dr. K.H. Muhammad Sirajudin Syamsudin, MA or commonly known as Din Syamsudin conveyed his opinion in the event with the theme &#8216;law, religion, and civilization: various approaches among civilizations&#8217;. He explained religion, law and civilization from a philosophical point of view based on Islamic religious principles and Islamic law. &#8220;The explanation of religion, law and civilization, especially in Islam, is based on the principles that were boldly mentioned before the metaphysics of Islamic scientists and the related Islamic legal system, and from that principle, I think that the Islamic legal system has developed. The common sense in the Islamic legal system is sharia, which consists of maqosid sharia, namely protection of faith, protection of life, protection of mind, protection of lines, and protection of property,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Based on the objectives of the Islamic legal system, namely maqosidul-syariah, the Islamic legal system aims to uphold the foundations of Islamic social thought with the aim of realizing a society that develops as just, prosperous and peaceful, based on moral and ethical values. In the Qur&#8217;an, it is called baldatun thoyibatun wa rabbun ghafur, &#8220;said Din again.</p>
<p>Din Syamsuddin also explained that the legal system is something that is vital, centralized and influences the development of the nation anywhere, including in Indonesia with a civil law, criminal law, and Islamic law systems. &#8220;The legal system in Indonesia cannot ignore the importance of Islamic law or laws that rely on religion. In this case, there are two approaches to developing a legal system in a country such as Indonesia which are Islamic law and customary law, which also relies on religious values and had been implemented since ancient times. The presence of positive laws based on religious values has created many other laws in Indonesia. For example, the concern of Muslims to regulate zakat law, marriage law, and also some expectations from family law, including commercial laws such as banking law and Islamic finance,&#8221; he concluded.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Covid-19 pandemic situation has changed the initial plan for the 2020 International Conference on Sustainable Innovation (ICOSI) at Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta. The conference, which initially will be carried out offline, must change to online and will be held tomorrow, Tuesday and Wednesday (13-14/10) . However, this did not diminish the enthusiasm of the organizing committee, who were UMY lecturers, to continue to provide facilities for experts and researchers from various countries, who concentrate on the world of education and industry to convey their knowledge and experiences in international conference forums.</p>
<p>The online-only ICOSI 2020 will make this international conference scheme difficult. Moreover, with the number of participants who likely exceeds 1000 people, it is necessary to implement new innovations. On the one hand, there is practicality for the participants because the online scheme can save their costs, but on the other hand, it is very difficult for the committee who need to prepare IT proper equipment. However, UMY Deputy Rector for Academic Affairs Dr. Ir. Sukamta MT., IPM., emphasized that UMY is ready to hold ICOSI 2020 online.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think UMY is ready to hold ICOSI 2020 online with existing IT facilities. To get around the large number of participants, not all participants made presentations in person. Instead, the participants were asked to make a video learning presentation by creating a Power Point that will be sent to the committee along with a full paper, then uploaded on the ICOSI 2020 website. Selected participants will be asked to make a live presentation via MS Teams or Zoom, Live Streaming on IG TV and Youtube. We estimate that there will be 1000 presenters,&#8221; said Sukamta, Monday (12/10).</p>
<p>ICOSI 2020 can be said to be the largest international conference yet because it will involve 14 conference focuses, Unlike the previous year which only involved 9 conference focuses. It could also break the MURI (Indonesian Museum of Records) record if it is able to fulfil the category of the highest number of abstracts and papers. &#8220;At ICOSI 2019, the number of abstracts was recorded at approximately 1300, 850 full papers, while this year we expect more than that number. Therefore, we have registered with the Indonesian Record Museum (MURI) for the international category of seminars with the highest number of abstracts or full papers, and the highest number of focal conferences, because previously there has never been an international seminar with more than 14 conferences, &#8221; added Sukamta.</p>
<p>UMY will not only host this international conference, but it will also involve lecturers to present their work. According to Sukamta, the existence of ICOSI has increased the number of UMY journals indexed by Scopus which is very useful for campus ranking both nationally and internationally.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will fully finance the registration fee for UMY lecturers in this international conference. We want them to be able to display and present their scientific work at the international level, with the hope that they will be able to contribute to international scopus indexed journals, or Scopus indexed proceedings. Because ICOSI has increased the number of UMY journals indexed by Scopus, This conference can increase university ranking through the contribution of the lecturers, &#8220;explained Sukamta further.</p>
<p>ICOSI 2020 collaborates with IOPScience, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), Energy, Engineering and Environmental Sciences (EEES), Atlantis Press, and Web of Science. In addition, ICOSI 2020 also collaborates with many international journal publishers indexed by Scopus.</p>
<p>The 15 Conference Focuses will include ICPU (2nd International Conference on Pharmaceutical Updates), ICOMS (6th International Conference on Management Sciences), ICLAS (9th International Conference on Law and Society), ICMHS (4th International Conference Medical and Health Sciences), ICAF (6th International Conference for Accounting and Finance), ILEC (2nd International Language and Education Conference), ICONURS (2nd International Conference on Nursing), ICITAMEE (International Conference on Information Technology, Advanced Mechanical and Electrical Engineering), IConARD (2nd International Conference of Agribusiness and Rural Development), ICONPO (10th International Conference on Public Organization), ISHERSS (2nd International Symposium on Social Humanities Education and Religious Sciences), DREAM (5th Dental Research and Exhibition Meeting (DREAM), ICHA (International Conference on Hospital Administration), and ICoSA (3rd International Conference on Sustainable Agriculture).
